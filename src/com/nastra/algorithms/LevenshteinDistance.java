/**
 * Given two character strings str1 and str2, the edit distance between them is
 * the minimum number of edit operations required to transform str1 into str2.
 * Most commonly, the edit operations allowed for this purpose are: (i) insert a
 * character into a string; (ii) delete a character from a string and (iii)
 * replace a character of a string by another character; for these operations,
 * edit distance is sometimes known as Levenshtein distance . For example, the
 * edit distance between cat and dog is 3.
